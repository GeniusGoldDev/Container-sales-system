Hi dear

this is joaquim.

Frankly i have one problem with me.

I think it is the better to communicate about your project via skype or email.

Fiverr platform has a lot of fee, it is 20% for me and 3% for you.

Actullay your budget is too low for me and Fiverr fee is too high. so If we create an offer in fiverr my total income will be $480 when you pay $600.

It's too difficult for me to proceed the task in fiverr.

And I will make progress to show you and commit into git repo. So you will check the progress daily and not worry about the work out of the fiverr.

hope you understand this problem.

I will wait your contact.

Thanks
